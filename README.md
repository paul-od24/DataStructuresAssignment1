# Iterative_Recursive_Algos

This repository contains algorithms for computing the factorial of a positive integer and performing various search operations. The algorithms are implemented using iterative and recursive approaches, with a focus on comparing their running times for different inputs.

# Task 1: Factorial Computation Algorithm
The first task involves writing an algorithm to compute the factorial of a positive integer n.

# Task 2: Factorial Implementation and Performance Comparison
For different values of n, the algorithm is implemented using both iterative and recursive approaches, including both tail and non-tail recursions. The running time for each case is plotted as a function of n to analyze and compare the performance of these approaches.

# Task 3: Search Algorithms Implementation
In this task, one of the sequences obtained from Task 2 is utilized as input for search algorithms. The following search methods are implemented:

Linear search: A simple algorithm that iterates through the sequence to find the desired element.
Iterative binary search: A search algorithm that uses a binary search approach iteratively to locate the desired element.
Recursive binary search: A recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm to search for the desired element.

# Task 4: Best and Worst Running Times for Search Algorithms
This task involves computing the best and worst running times for the implemented search algorithms. The aim is to analyze the performance characteristics of these algorithms under different scenarios.

Please refer to the individual files in this repository for detailed implementations of the algorithms and further explanations of the tasks.

Note: Ensure you have the necessary programming environment and dependencies set up to run the algorithms and analyze their performance.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different inputs, and assess the efficiency of the iterative and recursive algorithms and search methods. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
